> A small talk about my toy project

I have a kind of minor hobby, which is collecting vintage-style PVC dolls (the communities and users were active around 2016-7 but getting smaller nowðŸ˜¥). For me, it was pretty difficult to find information about collection unless I dig it up in the community forums by myself. So I thought it would be nice to have a sort of wikipedia, so I came up with this project.

## Project Requirements
First of all, in the first version, I decided to make features simply to search, filter, and sort the list of collections.

## Project Spec
* Duration: 3 ~ 4 weeks (I learned React with this project, so bit slow)
* Main language/framework : React, Redux, Semantic UI
* Datasource: Google Spreadsheet API (but all the data typed by myselfðŸ˜‚)
* EDR (SimpleðŸ˜­)

### Chitchat about the spec
> Since it was a non-profit website, I had to focus on *free of charge* servies.

#### Datasource
`Google Spreadsheet`: It needs to be able to be managed by non-developers, I mean like common KukuClara fans. So I decided to use Google Spreadsheet that I was working on. Google Spreadsheet is like Excel that people are used to, and it provides APIs, so I thought it would be available right away without any DB setup. Furthermore, I am planning to open the Data Source link at the bottom of the website soon, so everyone can review and make contribution.

#### Main Language
`React` & `Redux`: I tried to learn and use React this time because React is *hot* nowadays, even though I used Vue in my previous company. *Comparing the two later will be a good posting material.* I also used Redux, as a central store, to make state management between components less complicated.

#### UI Framework
`Semantic UI`: I can make UI with CSS somehow but I am aware that I am not that good at making good and clean UI design. Regardless of design, the library also offer lots of good features to make my app in handy way!

#### ETC.
I was thinking about how to make the required business logic for sorting and filtering. Should I just make API calls with a query, like SQL queries provided by Spreadsheet, or just developing them by JavaScript myself...? I was learning data structures and algorithms these days, so I decided to develop them myself. Therefore, I am using the API only to get the whole data list, and the business logic for search/filtering/sorting for basic listing features is currently handled by *reducers* (with my-not-that-efficient-functionsðŸ¤”).

## Things to update
* First of all, I think there will be a better algorithm to handle the business logic related to listing. I need to study more to have a better understanding of data structure and algorithm.
* The features are simple and cuteðŸ˜‚ I need to come up with more feature to get used to React also!
